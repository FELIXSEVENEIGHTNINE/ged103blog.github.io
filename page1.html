						Fort Drum (El Fraile Island), also known as the “concrete battleship,” is a heavily fortified island fortress situated at the mouth of 
						Manila Bay in the Philippines, due south of Corregidor Island. It was occupied by the Japanese in World War II, and was recaptured by the U.S. 
						after igniting oil and gasoline in the fort, leaving it permanently out of commission. Fort Drum was named for Brigadier General Richard C. Drum.

						An island that looks like a warship is an interesting sight to see. This was used as a base for the Americans during the Spanish-American war. I think this one shows 
						the relationship between the Americans and the Philippines. Who knows, maybe this could be used as a fall-back base if ever China decides to invade the Philippines. We just
						have to make it operational again...
